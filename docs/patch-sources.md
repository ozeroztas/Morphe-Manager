# Managing patch sources

A patch source is the bundle of patches Morphe applies to an app. Morphe ships with one
pre-installed source, **Morphe Patches**, and that is all most people ever need. You can add
more if you want patches from another maintainer, or a bundle you built yourself.

## The Patch sources sheet

Tap **Sources** at the bottom of the home screen. The sheet lists every source you have, with
the count in the subtitle and a **+** button to add another.

<p align="center">

</p>

Each card shows when the source was last updated, and a **Pre-installed** badge on the one
that ships with Morphe.

### What is on a source card

- **Patches** - how many patches the source provides. **Details** lists them all.
- **Version** - the version currently installed. **Details** opens its changelog.
- **Hidden for** - how many apps are kept from this source. Only shown once at least one is,
  and tapping it lists them so you can offer the source back.
- **Open in browser** - opens the source's repository or metadata URL.
- **Report an issue** - opens the issue tracker of that source, so a broken patch is reported
  to the people who wrote it rather than to Morphe.

A card can also carry a badge explaining why the source is not pulling its weight:

| Badge | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Metadata N/A** | The remote metadata could not be read. Patching with the bundle you already have still works, auto-update does not |
| **Update Morphe** | The source needs a newer patcher than this build of Morphe carries |
| **Crashed** | The source crashed Morphe while loading and is being skipped. Update or re-import it to try again |
| **Blocked** | The source is on the block list and its patches are not used |

### The toggles

**Pre-release patches** gives this source early access to new experimental patch versions.
With it off you only receive stable releases. It appears on sources that publish
pre-releases at all.

> [!NOTE]
> This is per source. The **Pre-release updates** setting in **Settings → Advanced → Updates**
> is a different thing, it controls early access to new versions of the Morphe app itself.

**Experimental app versions** makes this source patch experimental app targets when it has
them, so Morphe recommends a newer app version whose patches are still being refined. It
only appears when the source actually declares experimental targets, and on remote sources
it requires **Pre-release patches** to be on first, which is why it can disappear when you
turn that off.

> [!TIP]
> Expect quirks with experimental targets. Leave this off if you want the version the
> patches were tested against, see
> [Pick an APK version](patching-expert-mode.md#3-pick-an-apk-version).

### The action buttons

The pill row at the bottom of a card holds the actions available for that source:

| Icon | Action | Shown for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| circular arrow | **Update** - fetch the newest version now | Remote sources |
| crossed circle / check | **Disable** or **Enable** - keep the source without using its patches | Any source, once you have more than one |
| pencil | **Rename** - give the source your own display name | Sources you added |
| trash | **Delete** - remove the source, with a confirmation | Sources you added |

The pre-installed source cannot be renamed or deleted.

## Adding a source

Tap **+** and pick where the bundle comes from.

### Remote

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/patch-sources/02-add-remote.jpg" width="320" alt="Add patch source dialog, Remote tab" />
</p>

Paste the address. Morphe accepts a GitHub or GitLab repository, or a direct link to a
bundle's JSON metadata:

```
github.com/owner/repo
gitlab.com/owner/repo
example.com/patches-bundle.json
```

The field validates as you type and tells you whether the URL is usable before **Add**
becomes available. A repository URL also lets Morphe keep the source updated automatically.

A source can also arrive as a deep link, which carries the repository in the address:

```
https://morphe.software/add-source?github=owner/repo
https://morphe.software/add-source?gitlab=owner/repo
```

An optional `&name=` sets the display name. Opening such a link hands the repository to
Morphe, which asks **Do you want to add this patch source?** before anything is added. Only
GitHub and GitLab repositories are accepted this way.

> [!WARNING]
> Only add sources you trust. A patch source decides what ends up inside your patched apps.

### Local

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/patch-sources/03-add-local.jpg" width="320" alt="Add patch source dialog, Local tab" />
</p>

Pick a `.mpp` patch bundle from storage. Local sources never update on their own, you replace
the file yourself when a new one comes out.

## Using more than one source

Extra sources change how patching behaves:

- **Simple mode** asks which source to use in a **Select patch source** dialog whenever more
  than one has patches for the app you tapped.
- **Expert mode** gives each source its own tab on the patch selection screen. The action
  buttons there apply to the tab you are viewing.

### Choosing sources per app

A source that is on is offered to every app it has patches for. If you patch YouTube from one
source and Reddit from another, you can say so per app instead of switching sources off
globally.

Long-press an app on the home screen, select as many as you like, and tap **Patch sources** in
the bar. The dialog lists the sources that have patches for them, and unticking one stops it
being offered to those apps. A source you untick keeps its patches and stays on everywhere
else, and the patches it adds later never join a selection for these apps on their own.

In Simple mode the **Select patch source** dialog offers the same thing in passing: tick
**Always use this source for this app** and the sources you turned down stop being offered, so
the dialog has nothing left to ask next time.

Every app needs one source left to patch from, so the last one cannot be unticked.

Expert mode does not hide the fact: a source kept from the app is missing from the tabs, and a
notice above the list says how many. Tapping it shows them again for that run only, without
changing the decision.

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling patches from several sources for the same app is possible but risky. They are
> built independently and can conflict, so Morphe asks you to confirm before patching such a
> selection. Sticking to one source per app is the safe default.

The **Update** badge on a home card is tied to the source the app was patched with, see
[Updating a patched app](updating-patched-apps.md).

## Keeping sources up to date

Remote sources refresh in the background on the schedule set in
**Settings → Advanced → Updates**, and the **Update** pill on a card forces a check right
away. If **Mobile data updates** is off and you are not on Wi-Fi, checks are skipped and
Morphe warns you before patching with what may be an outdated bundle.

Sorting is available from the sheet: **Manual order** (long-press a card to drag it),
**Last updated**, or **Enabled first**.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| "This source has already been added" | The same URL is already in your list |
| "Invalid source URL" | The address must point to a GitHub or GitLab repository, or to a `.json` metadata file |
| **Blocked** badge on a source | The source is blocked and cannot be used. Remove it |
| **Metadata N/A** on a card | The remote metadata file is unavailable. Patching with the installed bundle still works, but this source will not auto-update |
| A patch shows an **Expert** badge | That patch is not part of the default selection. Enable Expert mode to include it manually |
| The file will not add | Local bundles must have the `.mpp` extension |
