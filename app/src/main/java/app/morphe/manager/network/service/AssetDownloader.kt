/**
 * Downloads release assets, rerouting through the GitHub API when the direct link cannot be
 * reached.
 *
 * Manifests and release metadata point at github.com because that is what release tooling emits,
 * but networks that drop that host while leaving api.github.com alone are common enough to make
 * both patch bundles and manager updates unreachable. Everything that fetches a release asset
 * goes through here so neither has to know about the detour.
 *
 * The same detour reaches assets of a private repository: github.com does not take a token on
 * its download links, while the API serves them to a PAT that can read the repository.
